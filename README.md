# Realtime Plot
<p> This application is based in Dotnet Framework 4.6.2, and Traditional Winform. The system will generate timer to update the chart. we selected line chart in this example. By Clicking the RUN button, the PlottTImer will be enabled. which will trigger the EventHandle Method to run the  RealTimePlot Class.
</p>

## General Future Plan: 

* Note: in future I am looking to use DotNet 8 or DotNet 9 to do the same application.
- Note: in future I will link this application to AFSDK to work as Client App of PI System.
+ Note: in future I will customize this code to show more smoothing updateed plot.

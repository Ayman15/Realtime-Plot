# Realtime Plot
<p> This application is based in Dotnet Framewairk 4.6.2, and Traditional Winform. The system will generate timer to update the chart. we selected line chart in this example. By Clicking the RUN button, the PlottTImer will be enabled. which will trigger the EventHandle Methob to run the  RealTimePlot Class.
</p>

## General Future Plan: 

* Note: in future I am looking to usie DotNet 8 or DotNet 9 to do the same application.
- Note: in future I will link this application to AF SDK.
+ Note: in future I will custimize this code to show more smoothing updateed plot.
